# Scraping Data from the web
The purpose of this repository is my self practice of scraping techniques with python. Exercise from the Book "Data Science from Scratch".

I am a student that is learning, let me know if you find any errors, **the original code is from examples and exercises found in books, tutorials and other sources all mentioned in this file.** I am just practicing what I have learned, the proper authors and creators of the algorithms/code are the ones mentioned in the file.

## Resources that I used to learn about this fun topic:
- Book: Data Science from Scratch, Joel Grus
